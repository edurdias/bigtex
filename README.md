# bigtex -> Shows Big Text On Screen

## Description
Shows big ass white text on a cozy smoked background.  Meant for sharing quick words w those special people around you.  For Windows my friends.

Potentially handy for things like "Resuming meeting at 1pm", answering a question like 'what's your twitter?' you put up "[@noahcoad](http://twitter.com/noahcoad)", or copy/pasting some code.

## Install & Use
Follow these steps
* **Download [bigtex.zip](support/bigtex.zip?raw=true)** and drop file contents somewhere handy
* Add a hotkey to launch the app, [here's how with AutoHotkey](http://noahcoad.com/post/646/create-a-global-hotkey-to-launch-a-program-with-autohotkey-on-windows)
* Hit your hotkey and start typing.  ESC exits

It does require [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=22).

## Options
Edit bigtex.config to adjust:

* Font Name & Size
* Put a black box behind the text
* Change or removing the start up text
* Opacity level of the smoke background

## Credits & History
One day I was using Mac OS X on my MacBook instead of my usual Windows 7, and accidentally hit some key that did this.  It looked nice, so I made this for Windows.  I wrote it at about 2am before bed, used it in a couple meetings in the morning, then tidied it up and posted on github while waiting to board my flight that afternoon.  That means it's just a simple little thing.  It was originally bigtext, then cut the t off the end in honor of [this guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tex).
